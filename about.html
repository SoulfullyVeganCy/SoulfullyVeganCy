		  <h2>My story</h2>
			 <p>Being born in a non-vegan family, I never gave much thought about where my food, clothes, and so on, came from. Sometime in 2018, while doing research on the raw food diet I came across some footage of the meat industry practices. I became immediately vegetarian, still having no knowledge about veganism.
	<br><br>
	Soon after, I was exposed to more and more footage of the cruel practices of the dairy industry, egg industry, etc, each time facing a new reality. I was finally making the connection, and opening my eyes to all the ways that humans were exploiting animals, causing them immense suffering and eventually death. Suddenly, the world became a very dark place and the truth scarred everlasting images into my retina. Not only I became vegan, but I also became passionate about animal rights. My mission is to spread the vegan message and help people get rid of the brainwashing they grew up with.
	<br><br>
	Going vegan was the best decision in my life. Knowing that I donâ€™t participate in the torture and exploitation of farm animals brought inner peace to myself. </p>
